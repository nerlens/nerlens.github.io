For those who are new to Visual Studio Code, here are some tips that I hope you will find helpful.

# The basics

### Open Command Palate

	CRTL + SHIFT + P

### Find things

	Open the Command Palate and just start typing stuff

	like Theme
	or Terminal
	or Git
	or whatever you are looking for

### Open settings tab

	CTRL + , 

### Remove minimap

	View -> Toggle Minimap

### Open and close integrated terminal

	CTRL + ` 

### Create new integrated terminal

	CTRL + SHIFT + `

### Terminal Splitting

	CTRL + \
	
###  Zen mode (full screen)

	CTRL + K  and then Z

###  Edit multiple items simultaneously
	
	Hold the ALT key and highlight text fields that you want to edit
	
# PowerShell stuff!

###  Install PowerShell Extension

Install the PowerShell extension from the Marketplace

###  Run Selection

	Highlight code + F8

###  Run full PowerShell scripts in VSCode

Install the Code Runner extension from the Marketplace

From the settings page, check the 'Code-Runner: Run In Terminal' checkbox so that your script will execute in the PowerShell terminal window.

Press the play button (top right corner of the editor window) to run a full script.  
(*One thing to note here is that, unlike the PowerShell ISE, **sadly** there is no stop button.*)
